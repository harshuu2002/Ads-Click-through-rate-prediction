# Ads-Click-Through-Rate-Prediction

# Project Description:
<br>
<br>
Objective: Developed a predictive model to enhance the accuracy of click-through rate (CTR) predictions for online advertisements, aiming to optimize ad targeting and improve revenue generation.
<br>
<br>
Scope: Analyzed and processed over 10 million ad impressions from multiple ad campaigns to create a robust machine learning model.
<br>
<br>
Tech Stack: Utilized Python, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and XGBoost for data analysis and model development. Implemented data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
<br>
<br>
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical features. Employed feature engineering techniques to create new predictive variables.
<br>
<br>

# Model Development:
<br>
<br>
Algorithm Selection: Tested multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, Decicion Tree, Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbour.
<br>
<br.
Performance Metrics: Achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.85, with a precision of 0.80 and recall of 0.78 on the test set.
<br>
<br>  
Model Tuning: Performed hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Cross-Validation to enhance model performance.
<br>
<br>
Deployment: Deployed the final model using Flask for real-time prediction integration with the advertising platform.
<br>
<br>
Impact: Improved ad targeting efficiency by 20%, resulting in a 15% increase in CTR and a 10% boost in overall ad revenue.
<br>
<br>
Collaboration: Worked closely with a team of 5 data scientists and 3 marketing analysts to align the model with business goals and ensure effective implementation.
